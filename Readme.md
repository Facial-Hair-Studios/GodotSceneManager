# Godot Level Manager
<p> Godot Level Manager is an attempt to help Godot recognize and manage what is a level vs a player or nonlevel / scene GameObject since all GameObjects are viewed as scenes in Godot there's been no real distinction between them until now. This allows a distinct separation between levels and game objects as well as a categorization of levels. </p>

### Features:
- Extensible API, inherit from Level common and define your Level type
- Can add or remove Levels in the editor.
- Has several key Unity like features for Level Creation and ingame management

### ToDo:
- Want to add a better UI to select type of new level to add based on currently known level types
- Add more complete functionality ala Unity or other LevelManager based Game Engines
